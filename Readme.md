Simple  perceptron.

Most simple task while learning neural networks. 

This perceptron is able to learn number 5 and determine if given digit is 5 even it had never seen such type of five before.

Run command: 

php perceptron crete 15 7

to create perceptron. Then enter a number of learning cycles.

To check result enter data in such format:

0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 

Which determine such type of 5:

0 1 1
1 0 0
0 1 1
0 0 1
1 1 1
